synopsis:
  "Camlp4 is a system for writing extensible parsers for programming languages"
description: """
It provides a set of OCaml libraries that are used to define grammars as well
as loadable syntax extensions of such grammars. Camlp4 stands for Caml
Preprocessor and Pretty-Printer and one of its most important applications is
the definition of domain-specific extensions of the syntax of OCaml.

Camlp4 was part of the official OCaml distribution until its version 4.01.0.
This package is therefore a dummy package that uses the existing camlp4
from the compiler."""
